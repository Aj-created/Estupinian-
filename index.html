  <h1>Welcome to EstupiÃ±an</h1>
  <p>
    EstupiÃ±an is not just a brand â€” itâ€™s a revival. A rebirth of culture, art, and power woven into every thread, metal, and silhouette. We draw from the pillars of ancient civilizations â€” where gods walked among men, and fashion was a symbol of identity, not industry. Inspired by Greek goddesses, African royalty, sacred geometry, and symbols of rebellion, EstupiÃ±an blends bold heritage with modern minimalism.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every piece is handmade with purpose. Whether it's the rugged strength of our cargos, the fluid elegance of our female line, or the mystic energy locked in our jewellery â€” we design not for trends, but for truths. 
    For the ones who walk different. Who speak through silence. Who carry the weight of legacy and still dare to dream louder.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our mission is simple â€” build wearable art that awakens. That roots you in where you come from, and points you toward where you could go. Fashion is not the goal â€” it is the language.
    And EstupiÃ±an? Thatâ€™s the voice.
